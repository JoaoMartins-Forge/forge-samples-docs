# Introduction

In this tutorial we're going to build a simple Forge application that lets us
upload, translate, and preview 3D designs and 2D drawings.

![Preview](./preview.gif)

We will use the following components of the platform:

- [Authentication service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Data Management service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Model Derivative service](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/developers_guide/overview)
- [Forge Viewer](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview)

:::tip
Full implementation of this sample is available on GitHub:
- For Node.js: https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-nodejs
- For .NET: https://github.com/petrbroz/forge-simple-viewer-dotnet
