## Token management

Create a `forge.js` file under the `services` subfolder. This is where we will be implementing
all the Forge-specific logic that will be used in different areas of our server application.
Let's start by adding the following code to the file:

```js title="services/forge.js"
const { AuthClientTwoLegged } = require('forge-apis');
const { FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET } = require('../config.js');

let internalAuthClient = new AuthClientTwoLegged(FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, ['bucket:read', 'bucket:create', 'data:read', 'data:write', 'data:create'], true);
let publicAuthClient = new AuthClientTwoLegged(FORGE_CLIENT_ID, FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET, ['viewables:read'], true);

async function getInternalToken() {
    if (!internalAuthClient.isAuthorized()) {
        await internalAuthClient.authenticate();
    }
    return internalAuthClient.getCredentials();
}

async function getPublicToken() {
    if (!publicAuthClient.isAuthorized()) {
        await publicAuthClient.authenticate();
    }
    return publicAuthClient.getCredentials();
}

module.exports = {
    getPublicToken,
};
```

The code creates two authentication clients, one for generating tokens for internal use
(giving us read/write access to the Data Management buckets and objects), and one for generating
tokens for public use (only giving a read access to the translation outputs from the Model Derivative
service), and two helper methods to generate the corresponding tokens for us. The `getPublicToken` function
is exported from this script as we will use it in another part of our server application.

## Server endpoints

Next, let's add a first endpoint to our server. Create an `auth.js` file under the `routes` subfolder
with the following content:

```js title="routes/auth.js"
const express = require('express');
const { getPublicToken } = require('../services/forge.js');

let router = express.Router();

router.get('/token', async function (req, res, next) {
    try {
        res.json(await getPublicToken());
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

Here we implement a new [Express Router](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#router) that will handle
requests coming to our server, with the URL ending with `/token`, by generating a public access token
and sending it back to the client as a JSON response.

Let's "mount" the router to our server application by modifying the `server.js`:

```js title="server.js"
const express = require('express');
const { PORT } = require('./config.js');

let app = express();
app.use(express.static('wwwroot'));
// highlight-start
app.use('/api/auth', require('./routes/auth.js'));
// highlight-end
app.listen(PORT, function () { console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}...`); });
```

:::info
Since the router has been attached to the `/api/auth` prefix, it will now handle all requests
coming to the endpoint `/api/auth/token`.
:::

## Try it out

Let's see if our new server endpoint works. Don't forget setting your Forge client ID and client secret
as the `FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables, and run the application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
npm start
```

If the application starts successfully and you navigate to [http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token](http://localhost:8080/api/auth/token)
in the browser, the server should respond with a JSON object containing the access token data.
