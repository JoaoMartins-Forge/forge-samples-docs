## Project & dependencies

Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it in the command line, and initialize a new
ASP.NET Core project:

```bash
dotnet new web
```

Next we will need to install the dependencies. In this case it will just be the
[Forge SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Forge):

```bash
dotnet add package Autodesk.Forge
```

The `*.csproj` file in your project should now look similar to this (possibly with
slightly different version numbers, and additional .NET settings):

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Autodesk.Forge" Version="1.9.0" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>

```

Finally, let's create a couple more subfolders in your project folder that we're going to need later:

- `Controllers` - this is where we're going to implement all the server endpoints
- `Models` - here we're going to keep all the server-side logic that can be shared by different endpoints
- `wwwroot` - this is where we're going to put all the client side assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)

## Application config

When the `dotnet` utility bootstrapped your application, it generated random port numbers
for its HTTP and HTTPS addresses. Let's change those to specific port numbers (8080 for HTTP,
and 8081 for HTTPS) that we will use throughout this tutorial.

Open the `launchSettings.json` file under the `Properties` folder, and set the `applicationUrl`
property to `https://localhost:8081;http://localhost:8080`.

## Create a basic server

Next we'll setup our basic server. Start by creating a `Startup.cs` file in the root folder
of your project with the following content:

```csharp title="Startup.cs"
using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
        var ForgeClientID = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("FORGE_CLIENT_ID");
        var ForgeClientSecret = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET");
        var ForgeBucket = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("FORGE_BUCKET"); // Optional
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(ForgeClientID) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(ForgeClientSecret))
        {
            throw new ApplicationException("Missing required environment variables FORGE_CLIENT_ID or FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET.");
        }
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseDefaultFiles();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

The `Startup` class is responsible for configuring our server and its "middleware", for example,
serving of static files. We also try and retrieve the Forge application client ID and secret
(these are the values you obtain when [creating a new Forge application](../../../intro#create-an-app))
from environment variables for later use.

Next, replace the content of `Program.cs` with the following:

```csharp title="Program.cs"
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

This code will make sure that the .NET application creates a web server with our
new `Startup` class.

## Try it out

Now that we have a basic ASP.NET application setup, let's try it out. In the command line,
setup the two required environment variables, `FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
and run the .NET application:

```bash
export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=your-own-forge-client-id
export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-own-forge-client-secret
dotnet run
```

When you navigate to [https://localhost:8081](https://localhost:8081) in your browser, you should
get a 404 response because we haven't implemented any server logic yet. That's going to be the topic
of the next step.
