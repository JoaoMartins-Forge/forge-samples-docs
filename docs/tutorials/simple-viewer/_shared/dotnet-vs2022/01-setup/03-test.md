Now that we have a basic ASP.NET application setup, let's try it out!

In order to be able to run our app, we need to provide a "launch configuration" for it,
specifying things such as the environment variables, and the address and port the server should
be listening on. Open the `launchSettings.json` file in the `Properties` folder, add the
`FORGE_CLIENT_ID` and `FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables with your Forge app credentials
(and optionally the `FORGE_BUCKET` variable if you already have a bucket you want to use),
and set the `applicationUrl` to `https://localhost:8081;http://localhost:8080`.

With your new launch settings, you can now start the application (for example, using
the _Debug_ > _Start Debugging_ menu item, or by pressing `F5`). Visual Studio will automatically
open the [https://localhost:8081](https://localhost:8081) URL in your browser. You should get
a 404 response because we haven't implemented any server logic yet. That's going to be the goal
of the next step.

When starting the application for the first time you may be prompted to trust the self-signed
SSL certificate generated by ASP.NET Core. This is expected, and you can accept this prompt.
